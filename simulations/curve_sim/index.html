            <p>
                Move your mouse to simulate the position of the ball. The white line shows the path that the robot will take to get there. Red sections of the path 
                indicate where the robot will push the ball in the wrong direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                This program was used to evaluate turn function choices in the main program, the aim is to minimize the red region where the ball will be pushed the wrong way.
                Calculate this region by pressing space.
